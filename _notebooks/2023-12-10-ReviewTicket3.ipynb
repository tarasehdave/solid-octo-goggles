    "### Memory Game Review Ticket \n",
    "\n",
    "This code creates a memory card game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure defines the basic layout for the game, including the game board. CSS styles handle the appearance of the cards, their flipping animation, and layout. The JavaScript logic initializes the game by setting up card values, creating pairs, shuffling them, and dynamically generating card elements based on these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game logic manages the card flipping functionality: when cards are clicked, they flip to reveal their content (ASCII and binary representations of characters). The code ensures that only two cards can be flipped at a time. If the flipped cards match, they stay visible; otherwise, they flip back after a brief delay. The game continues until all pairs are matched, triggering an alert to congratulate the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the code combines HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity to create a memory card game where players match pairs based on ASCII and binary representations."
