    "### Tara Sehdave\n",
    "\n",
    "This code creates a memory card game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure defines the basic layout for the game, including the game board. CSS styles handle the appearance of the cards, their flipping animation, and layout. The JavaScript logic initializes the game by setting up card values, creating pairs, shuffling them, and dynamically generating card elements based on these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game logic manages the card flipping functionality: when cards are clicked, they flip to reveal their content (ASCII and binary representations of characters). The code ensures that only two cards can be flipped at a time. If the flipped cards match, they stay visible; otherwise, they flip back after a brief delay. The game continues until all pairs are matched, triggering an alert to congratulate the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the code combines HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity to create a memory card game where players match pairs based on ASCII and binary representations. Using the hint, users are able to use the ASCII conversion of 'A' to then binary as a reference for the other letters. This helps the users learn more about the \n",

    "### Challenges \n",
    "\n",
    "When writing this code, I faced several changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- I had not only worked with frontend before, the last project I did for N@TM, I only worked on backend so I asked Sharon and external sources for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I had trouble finding out what game to make so I presented my project to Mr. Lopez and asked for feedback. That is when he told me to make it like a traditional memory game with matching pairs of ASCII and binary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After making this version, I was concerned about the learning aspect of it. So in my live review with Mr. Mortensen, I asked if I should keep both values on each card or split it up and then have the users do the math, to which he went with the second option. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrospective \n",
    "\n",
    "After being reviewed by a peer grader, Anika, I changed some aspects about my feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  I seperated binary and ASCII values to add a learning component to the game. If both values are on one card, users will just match cards visually instead of actually learning what the corresponding binary value should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I added a hint to the top of my title. It says what the ASCII number for 'A' is and it's corresponding binary value. This allows users to have a reference to help with other conversions. The game is already pretty difficult\n",
    "\n",
    "- I added a clearer background. This wasn't recommended, but I felt that it looked better after. "

    "-  The RGb to hexadecimal drawing game is one that I developed to heducate users about the relationship between RGB values and hexadecimals. In this game the user can chose a random RGB value and then the algorithm converts this into a hexadecimal value which is diplayed with its corresponding color. I also added a table below wih conversions to binary and octal which is talked about in our other features so the user is able to use their previous undersatdning to help them. I also worked on a educational pop up which helps the user understand how the converstion from RGB to hexadecimal works and defines the basics of hexadecimals. The user is also able to move the drop down to see the changes in color and draw on a canvas uing the colors they generated. \n",

    "- I had a hard time coming up with an inital idea that can be interactive for the user and I didnt really follow my inital plan but I was able to add into the initial plan I had to make it more interactive. \n",
    "- Initially I started with converting RGB to binary numbers, but as I researched more I learned that hexadecimals would be better to use since they directly make a color code. \n",
    "- I started off with asking chatgpt for a outline for my project, however I noticed that gpt was not able to convert RGB to hexadecimal and instead it just made the hexadecimal by concatinating the numbers\n",

    "# Binary conversion game \n",
    "### Peyton Leigh\n",
    "\n",
    "My code is of a game focused on binary-to-decimal number conversion. The HTML document incorporates Jekyll front matter for metadata, such as the layout, title, and courses. The body of the HTML contains game-related content, including instructions, input fields, buttons, and visual representations. The CSS styles define the presentation of various elements on the page, such as fonts, colors, and layout. The JavaScript portion of the code manages the game logic, including the generation of a random decimal number between 0 and 255, the conversion of this number to binary, and the subsequent display of the binary representation to the user. Users can input their decimal guesses, and the game checks the correctness, displaying appropriate messages and updating visual elements accordingly. The script also handles user interactions with individual bits, allowing them to add or subtract from the displayed binary number, with corresponding updates to decimal and hexadecimal representations. Additionally, the code includes functionality for reloading the page and displaying instructions through a modal. Overall, the code creates an interactive and visually engaging learning experience for binary-to-decimal conversion.\n",

    "The issues that I ran into included:\n",
    "- incorporating the \"lightbulb\" switch aspect onto the main feature game page in a manner that would still allow the user to learn\n",
    "- Increasing the aesthetic level of my feature by changing the formatting, adding images, and colors\n",
    "- Creating an entertaining game in an educational manner in a way that wouldn't be too easy for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrospective\n",
    "If I had more time, I would have increased the aesthetic aspect of my feature. I wanted to incorporate a mechanism that could help the user tally the amount of right and wrong answers they had, and I should have designed it so that the game would generate a new binary number automatically after the user entered a number. I would also have liked to increase the user interaction and feedback, possibly highlighting if they got the answer right or wrong with colors. Hexadecimal is another aspect that I want to add to the conversion game."
