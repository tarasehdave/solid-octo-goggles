    "I went through several versions of a memory game before landing on this specific style. After getting feedback from my peers and Mr. Lopez, I landed on the traditional style of having pairs of cards in which the user has to find the corresponding one. My plan for next week is to start coding. I researched and found the Fisher-Yates algorithm, which shuffles a finite sequence. Using that, I can mix the cards up. \n"
